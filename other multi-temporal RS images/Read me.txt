Dataset for multi-temporal RS images

Data1: This dataset was taken on Western Australia, Australia by Landsat-8, and there are ﬁve
       spectral bands (Band1, Band2, Band3, Band4, Band5) with a spatial resolution of 30 m in each temporal node.
       The data size is 400 × 400 × 5 × 5.

Data2: This dataset was taken on Tocantins, Brazil by Landsat-8, and there are ﬁve spectral bands (Band1,
       Band2, Band3, Band4, Band5) with a spatial resolution of 30 m in each temporal node. 
       The data size is 512 × 512 × 5 × 6.

Data3: This dataset was taken on Arizona, America by Sentinel-2, and there are four spectral bands (Band2,
        Band3, Band4, Band8) with a spatial resolution of 30 m in each temporal node. 
        The data size is 600×600×4×6.
